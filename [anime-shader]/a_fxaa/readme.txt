Original description:

A non-optimized rendered image of a 3d application often has jaggy edges on borders of objects, 
which look like stairs and also like sh*t. Anti Aliasing tries to find a balance between blurring 
an image to cover these jaggy edges and keeping the sharpness. The FXAA here is more performance-friendly 
than the ingame Anti Aliasing.

Additional description:
Using readable depth buffer effects (like ssao, dof) and mrt shaders (dl_core) 
disables in game antialiasing. This resource is meant to fix that.
